### Hey 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on my first feature length video game.  
🌱 I’ve been teaching myself to play the piano for 7 months so far...
💬 Ask me about Formula 1, video games and why this isn't the year that everybody switches to Linux.
⚡ ~~Fun	~~ fact: Bears eat beets.
📫 How to reach me: I've had my phone on silent since the day I bought it, but you'll find me on Twitter (@SamJordan_) and Discord (Samuel#8312) or you can drop me an email :)
